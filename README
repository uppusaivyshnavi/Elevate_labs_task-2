# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective

The goal of this task is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns, trends, correlations, and distributions in the data using Python libraries.

---

## Tools Used

- Python 3.11
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## Dataset

The dataset used is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle:
- [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)
- Loaded using `archive.zip` in the code.

---

## Steps Performed

1. **Import Libraries**: Loaded all required libraries for data analysis and visualization.
2. **Read Dataset**: Extracted the Titanic dataset from `archive.zip` and loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
3. **Initial Exploration**:
   - Displayed first few rows
   - Checked dataset structure using `.info()`
   - Counted missing values
   - Generated descriptive statistics
4. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Filled missing `Age` values with median
   - Filled missing `Embarked` values with mode
   - Dropped unnecessary columns like `Cabin`, `Ticket`, `Name`, and `PassengerId`
5. **Encoding**:
   - Converted `Sex` column to numerical (0 for male, 1 for female)
   - Applied one-hot encoding on `Embarked` with `pd.get_dummies()`
6. **Visualizations**:
   - Histograms for numeric feature distribution
   - Boxplots for `Age` vs `Survived` and `Fare` vs `Pclass`
   - Correlation matrix using heatmap
   - Pairplot of selected features (`Survived`, `Age`, `Pclass`, `Fare`)
7. **Skewness Analysis**:
   - Calculated skewness of numerical features
   - Visualized skewed distribution (e.g., `Fare`)

## Key Visual Outputs

- Histograms of all numeric features
- Boxplots comparing age and fare by survival/class
- Correlation heatmap between numeric features
- Pairplot for feature relationship visualization
- Histogram for detecting skewness

##  Insights

- `Sex`, `Pclass`, and `Fare` have strong correlation with survival
- The `Fare` distribution is heavily skewed
- Many passengers have missing age values that needed imputation
- Females had higher survival rate than males
